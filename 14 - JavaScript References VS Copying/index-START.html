    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
      let team = players
      console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = 'hufflepuff'
    // however what happens when we update that array?

      console.log(players, team)

    //updating array on reference changes orriginal array!!!! ^^^^^^^^

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      let team2 = players.slice()
    // one way
      team[3] = 'hufflepuff'

      console.log(players, team2)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      let team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team4[1] = 'lions'
      console.log(players, team4)

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const leader = person
    leader.age = 12
    console.log(leader)
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const myGuy = Object.assign({}, person)
    myGuy.age = 33
    myGuy.name = 'Star Fox'
    console.log(person, myGuy)

    const yourGuy = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'pika', age: 77})

    console.log(person, yourGuy)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
